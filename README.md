ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @CodeOxymoron

I am a technology professional and enthusiast who dabbles in so many things I don't think I could list them all here. ðŸ˜‹

I will be honest with you; I have no official degree in programming.  
I have either taught myself or learned from others all the programming I know.  
I am always open to constructive criticism, but I respond negatively towards being told I am wrong without an explanation of why or direction on how to learn why I am wrong.

I have actively avoided using Github until now for personal reasons, but I am here now.  
I hope to have mostly positive experiences here and look forward to using the platform.
